7. **Find the Server IP Address:**
   In the shortcut details window, you will find the IP address of the server. In this case, the IP address of the server is 172.16.60.17: 
   
9. **SSH to the Server:**
   Use the obtained IP address to SSH into the server using the following command:
   ```
   ssh username@ipaddress                     
   ```
   
10. **Check Available Accelerators:**
Once connected to the server, type the following command to see available accelerator cards in the system:
   ```
   lspci | grep accelerator
   ```
The output of this command will display the available accelerator cards, such as:
   ```

   ```

8. **Running the Docker Containers:**
Each container has a `spinup.sh` script that launches the container and detects any runAI200 devices on the host. Devices found by the kernel module will appear as `/dev/uai*` both on the host and inside the container.
