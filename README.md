# Untether tsunAImi tsn200ES Accelerator

The runAI200™ accelerator is designed to deliver real-time deep learning inference and high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities. With a unique at-memory architecture, it combines over 260,000 processing elements, 511 custom RISC-V processors, and 204 MB of SRAM, making it the industry's most efficient chip in its class, achieving an impressive 8 TOPs/W. The imAIgine™ software development kit (SDK) further enhances its potential by enabling easy integration with standard frameworks and offering a custom kernel development flow for high-performance computing applications with arbitrary computation requirements.

## Key Features
- 502 INT8 TOPs, 204MB on-chip SRAM, 75W TDP (40W typical)
- 8 TOPs/W, At-Memory Architecture, Scalable voltage and frequency
- Low latency, native batch = 1
- PCIe Gen4 x16
