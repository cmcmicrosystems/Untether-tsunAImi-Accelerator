# Getting Started with Untether tsunAImi tsn200ES Accelerator
To start using the Untether tsunAImi tsn200ES Accelerator, follow these steps:
1. **Download and Install CADPass:**
   Download [CADPass](https://www.cmc.ca/cadpass/) from the provided link and install it on your system.
   
2. **Login to CADPass:**
   Use your CMC microsystems credentials to log in to CADPass. After logging in, you will see the following window:

3. **Obtain AI Jupyter Notebook Shortcut Details:**
   Right-click on AI Jupyter Notebook and select "Shortcut details" as shown in the following figure:

</p>

5. **Find the Server IP Address:**
   In the shortcut details window, you will find the IP address of the server. In this case, the IP address of the server is 172.16.60.17:    
6. **SSH to the Server:**
   Use the obtained IP address to SSH into the server using the following command:
   ```
   ssh username@ipaddress                     
   ```
7. **Copy the configuration script and tutorials:**
   ```
   cp -r -a /CMC/* /home/username
   cd /home/username/untether
   ```
8. **Change permission of your directory and files**
   ```
   chmod-R a+rwx /home/username/untether
   ```   
9. **Check Available Accelerators:**
Once connected to the server, type the following command to see available accelerator cards in the system:
   ```
   lspci | grep accelerator
   ```
The output of this command will display the available accelerator cards, such as:
   ```
   86:00.0 Processing accelerators: Untether AI runAI200 AI Inference Accelerator (rev 01)
   ```
9. **Running the Docker Containers:**

Before launching the container, type the following command in a separate terminal to establish a secure shell (SSH) connection to the server with the ipaddress, using your username and port 22.
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 username@ipaddress -p 22
```
 The options used in the command are:

-N: Instructs SSH not to execute any remote commands after establishing the connection.
-f: Requests SSH to go into the background just before command execution.
-L localhost:8888:localhost:8888: Sets up local port forwarding, where connections to port 8888 on the local machine are forwarded securely through the SSH tunnel to port 8888 on the remote server.
username@ipaddress: Specifies the username ("username") and the IP address of the remote server.
-p 22: Specifies the port number (22) to use for the SSH connection.

Each container has a `spinup.sh` script that launches the container and detects any runAI200 devices on the host. Devices found by the kernel module will appear as `/dev/uai*` both on the host and inside the container.

Type './spinup.sh' to launch the container as shown in the following image:

To access Jupyter Notebook from outside the container, type the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 -m notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --nobrowser $
```
Use the token generated by the running Jupyter Notebook session.
